# kubernetes-the-hardway
## What I've learned
- I learned a great deal about AWS CLI and it's "--query" feature, and about jq as well.
- I learned about how to set up etcd and log the bug (which is a big deal when working with kubernetes)
- I also have a glimpse of how pod networking in kubernetes might be accomplished using AWS Routing Tables
- To bootstrap a K8S Cluster, simply run (make sure you have your AWS credentials ready): 
```bash
./0_provision.sh
```
